Here's a Java programming problem that integrates physics concepts with object-oriented programming, specifically using abstract classes and interfaces.

---

### **Problem Statement:**
You are designing a **Physics Simulation System** in Java. The system should be able to simulate different types of motion based on Newtonian mechanics. Your goal is to create an application where different objects (like a **ball**, a **car**, or a **rocket**) move based on their respective physical properties.

---

### **Requirements:**
1. **Create an abstract class `MovingObject`** that:
   - Has attributes for `mass` (kg) and `velocity` (m/s).
   - Defines an abstract method `updatePosition(double time)`, which updates the position after a given time.

2. **Create an interface `ForceApplicable`** that:
   - Defines a method `applyForce(double force, double time)`, which updates the velocity of the object based on Newton's Second Law of Motion:
     \[
     a = \frac{F}{m}
     \]
     \[
     v = u + at
     \]
     Where:
     - \( a \) is acceleration
     - \( F \) is the applied force
     - \( m \) is mass
     - \( v \) is final velocity
     - \( u \) is initial velocity
     - \( t \) is time duration

3. **Create at least two concrete classes (`Ball` and `Car`)** that:
   - Extend `MovingObject`.
   - Implement `ForceApplicable`.
   - Maintain an attribute for `position` and implement `updatePosition(double time)`, using:
     \[
     s = ut + \frac{1}{2} a t^2
     \]
     Where:
     - \( s \) is the displacement
     - \( u \) is initial velocity
     - \( a \) is acceleration
     - \( t \) is time

4. **Test your implementation** in a `main` method:
   - Create a `Ball` and `Car` object.
   - Apply force to both objects and update their positions.
   - Print their new positions and velocities.
